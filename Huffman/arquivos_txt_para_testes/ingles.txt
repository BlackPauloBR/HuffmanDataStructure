Nancy is hungry.

She goes to the refrigerator for snacking some tasty treats before lunch.

Sara is Nancy's mother.

She is preparing a delicious pasta for lunch with a refreshing orange juice.

Seeing Nancy eating a slice of cake, Sara says, 'If you eat cake now, you will not be hungry for lunch'.

Upset, Nancy says she got up very early and is already starving, 'Mom, I'm hungry'.
